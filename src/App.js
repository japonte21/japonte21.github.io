            <EuiText>
              <p>
                I am a senior at Williams College, double majoring in Computer
                Science and Studio Art, with a concentration in Latina/o
                Studies. I am primarily interested in software engineering,
                developing application software, and generally learning how a
                programming language works. I'm currently learning how to work
                on editing websites using HTML and CSS, but I also have
                experience with content management systems, such as WordPress.
                After graduation, I hope to work with a company to create new
                tools that can be useful for everyday life by creating
                implementations for things that may not seem connected to
                coding.
              </p>

              <p>
                Aside from computer science, I use a lot of my free time to
                develop my art skills in different mediums, primarily
                photography and drawing. While on campus, I participate in an
                West African drum and dance group called Kusika, as well as
                volunteer to help with a first-year orientation group focused on
                identity, sustainability, and social justice, called Root.
